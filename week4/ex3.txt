For n = 3, before first fork I have something like this
init─┬─init───init───bash─┬─ex3
     │                    └─pstree
     └─{init}
I see that there is new ex3 process, and it's looks fine (1 process in total)

after `fork()` calling I have this 
init─┬─init───init───bash─┬─ex3───ex3
     │                    └─pstree
     └─{init}
This also looks fine, because I have parent process ex3 and his child ex3 (2 process in total)

But after next fork I have 
init─┬─init───init───bash─┬─ex3─┬─ex3───ex3
     │                    │     └─ex3
     │                    └─pstree
     └─{init}
Here, as I understand, our first child process also created a process, and so
main process created a process and first child of main process created a process (4 in total)

...
Finally I have following 
init─┬─init───init───bash─┬─ex3─┬─ex3─┬─ex3───ex3
     │                    │     │     └─ex3
     │                    │     ├─ex3───ex3
     │                    │     └─ex3
     │                    └─pstree
     └─{init}
So, I can conlcude that each child process also creates process in this loop. (8 proceses in total).
And formula will be 2^n of total number of process, including the main process.


For n = 5. We have the same situation. 
And in the end there are 32 processes in total, including the main process.
