If we will access the pages that were already accessed recently, then we will
increase ratio (Hit/Miss)
For instance (high ratio = 2), n=2
1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5

If we will access new pages each tick or the pages that were accessed
long time ago, which would not be in table, because they will be replaced
with other pages.
For instance (low ratio = 0.176471), n = 2
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
