Comparing with first come first served (FCFS) the shortest job first algorithm shows
that this solution is better than first one.
Firstly, the average turnaround time for each job would be minimal, because we pick the shortest
job first.
Secondly, we minimize the mean of average turnaround. For example for 4 jobs
where a,b,c,d are execution times we have (4a + 3b + 2c + d)/4. From this formula we
see that we first need minimize a then b then c then d respectively. And by this algorithm we do it.

But sometimes we have another situation. Example from book - 
```As a counterexample, consider five jobs, A through
E, with run times of 2, 4, 1, 1, and 1, respectively. Their arrival times are 0, 0, 3, 3,
and 3. Initially, only A or B can be chosen, since the other three jobs have not arri-
ved yet. Using shortest job first, we will run the jobs in the order A, B, C, D, E, for
an average wait of 4.6. However, running them in the order B, C, D, E, A has an
average wait of 4.4```
