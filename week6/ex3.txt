After several tests I see that for very small quatum the results 
are not such good as preveous algortithms results.

But by manually changing the quatum Average Turnaround time, Average waiting time,
Completion time and other timing for each process are decreasing. This states that
right chosing of the quatum can decrease the timings comparing with preveous algortithms.
