Physical address is a addres of physical cell in memory device, for instance RAM.

Virtual address is an abstract address, which is mapped into physical address.

As I understand the difference is that with physical addressing programs exactly 
knows the real layout of RAM, as opposed to virtual addressing, where programs go to 
a page table, which then maps from the virtual to physical address. So every program has its own
"private" address space.
